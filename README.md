> [Junior Site Reliability Engineer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hostert/) | [Infinite Cloud Computing](https://goinfinite.net)

Systems Administrator since 2004.
Currently learning how to upgrade myself into Site Reliability Engineering as a way to contribute to the best support team for webhosting in Brazil (soon the world).

- ⚡ Fun fact: I liked so much [William's profile page](https://github.com/william-costa) so I had to make my own :)
